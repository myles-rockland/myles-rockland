## Myles "Rockm" Rockland

My name is Myles Rockland, but I'm also known as Rockm in various online spaces.

I'm a gameplay programmer with a hand in community management and event organisation for various game development companies.

My latest project is PassBy, a mobile game that uses pseudo-multiplayer features to help players feel more in touch with their community.

My current aim is to secure a role within the games industry as a gameplay programmer.
