## Myles "Rockm" Rockland

My name is Myles Rockland, but I'm also known as Rockm in various online spaces.

I'm a gameplay programmer with a hand in community management and event organisation for game development companies.

My latest project is [PassBy](https://github.com/myles-rockland/passby), a mobile game that uses pseudo-multiplayer features to help players feel more in touch with their community.

My current aim is to secure an entry-level role within the games industry, primarily as a gameplay programmer.

If you need someone who can program games, run online events, or manage communities, let's get in touch 🙂
